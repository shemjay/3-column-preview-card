### What I learned

1. I learned how to use blend mode to blend elements with their beackground color in specific ways. While I may not have used it in my final solution it was still very interesting to learn about.

2. Learned a bit more on how to style buttons in css:

```css
.flex-input {
    font-family: 'Lexend Deca';
    width: 60%;
    cursor: pointer;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 95%);
    color: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.75);
    outline: none;
    padding: 1em;
    margin-left: 3em;
    margin-top: 4em;
    border-radius: 25px;
    border: none;
}
```

### Continued development

How to properly position elements within flex children. I still use very unprofessional methods to position text and images in flex children. Still getting the hang of it.
